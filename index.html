    <h1>The problem:</h1>
    <p>There are 100 light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each bulb has its own switch and is currently switched off.
        The room has an entry door and an exit door. There are 100 people lined up outside the entry door. Each bulb is numbered
        consecutively from 1 to 100. So is each person. Person No. 1 enters the room, switches on every bulb, and exits.
        Person No. 2 enters and flips the switch on every second bulb (turning off bulbs 2, 4, 6, ...). Person No. 3 enters
        and flips the switch on every third bulb (changing the state on bulbs 3, 6, 9, ...). This continues until all 100
        people have passed through the room. How many of the light bulbs are illuminated after the 100th person has passed
        through the room? More specifically, which light bulbs are still illuminated, and why?</p>
    <h1>The solution:</h1>
    <p>As each user goes into the room and changes the state of light bulbs in multiples of his or her line number a pattern
        begins to emerge. What you recognize is that the state of each light bulb at the end directly corresponds to the
        number of factors of the light bulb's position number (within the range of users). Take the scenario where there
        are 50 light bulbs and 10 users. We can easily predict the state of any light bulb in the sequence at the end based
        on whether it has an even or odd number of factors in from within the range of users (1–10). For example, I know
        that light bulb 36 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36) will be off after all users have gone through the room
        because it has an even number of factors within the range of users (factors ≤ 10: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9).</p>
